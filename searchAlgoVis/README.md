# Graph Algorithms Visualization

Creates a html grid that represents a graph data structure. The user can select cells on the grid to specify walls, set start cells, and set end cells. They can then specify a traversal or search algorithm to simulate. A css animation will play showing how each cell is traversed based on the specified algorithm. Mazes or walls can be randomly generated to show more interesting applications of graph algorithms.
